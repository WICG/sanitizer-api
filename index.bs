# Introduction # {#intro}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Web applications often need to work with strings of HTML on the client side,
perhaps as part of a client-side templating solution, perhaps as part of
rendering user generated content, etc. It is difficult to do so in a safe way.
The naive approach of joining strings together and stuffing them into
an {{Element}}'s {{Element/innerHTML}} is fraught with risk, as it can cause
JavaScript execution in a number of unexpected ways.

Libraries like [[DOMPURIFY]] attempt to manage this problem by carefully
parsing and sanitizing strings before insertion, by constructing a DOM and
filtering its members through an allow-list. This has proven to be a fragile
approach, as the parsing APIs exposed to the web don't always map in
reasonable ways to the browser's behavior when actually rendering a string as
HTML in the "real" DOM. Moreover, the libraries need to keep on top of
browsers' changing behavior over time; things that once were safe may turn
into time-bombs based on new platform-level features.

The browser has a fairly good idea of when it is going to
execute code. We can improve upon the user-space libraries by teaching the
browser how to render HTML from an arbitrary string in a safe manner, and do
so in a way that is much more likely to be maintained and updated along with
the browser's own changing parser implementation. This document outlines an
API which aims to do just that.

## Goals ## {#goals}

*   Mitigate the risk of DOM-based cross-site scripting attacks by providing
    developers with mechanisms for handling user-controlled HTML which prevent
    direct script execution upon injection.

*   Make HTML output safe for use within the current user agent, taking into
    account its current understanding of HTML.

*   Allow developers to override the defaults set of elements and attributes.
    Adding certain elements and attributes can prevent
    <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/tree/master/script-gadgets">script gadget</a>
    attacks.

## API Summary ## {#api-summary}

# Framework # {#framework}

# Algorithms # {#algorithms}

# Security Considerations # {#security-considerations}

The Sanitizer API is intended to prevent DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting
by traversing a supplied HTML content and removing elements and attributes
according to a configuration. The specified API must not support
the construction of a Sanitizer object that leaves script-capable markup in
and doing so would be a bug in the threat model.

That being said, there are security issues which the correct usage of the
Sanitizer API will not be able to protect against and the scenarios will be
laid out in the following sections.

## Server-Side Reflected and Stored XSS ## {#server-side-xss}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

The Sanitizer API operates solely in the DOM and adds a capability to traverse
and filter an existing DocumentFragment. The Sanitizer does not address
server-side reflected or stored XSS.

## DOM clobbering ## {#dom-clobbering}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

DOM clobbering describes an attack in which malicious HTML confuses an
application by naming elements through `id` or `name` attributes such that
properties like `children` of an HTML element in the DOM are overshadowed by
the malicious content.

The Sanitizer API does not protect DOM clobbering attacks in its
default state, but can be configured to remove `id` and `name` attributes.

## XSS with Script gadgets ## {#script-gadgets}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Script gadgets are a technique in which an attacker uses existing application
code from popular JavaScript libraries to cause their own code to execute.
This is often done by injecting innocent-looking code or seemingly inert
DOM nodes that is only parsed and interpreted by a framework which then
performs the execution of JavaScript based on that input.

The Sanitizer API can not prevent these attacks, but requires page authors to
explicitly allow unknown elements in general, and authors must additionally
explicitly configure unknown attributes and elements and markup that is known
to be widely used for templating and framework-specific code,
like `data-` and `slot` attributes and elements like `<slot>` and `<template>`.
We believe that these restrictions are not exhaustive and encourage page
authors to examine their third party libraries for this behavior.

## Mutated XSS ## {#mutated-xss}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Mutated XSS or mXSS describes an attack based on parser context mismatches
when parsing an HTML snippet without the correct context. In particular,
when a parsed HTML fragment has been serialized to a string, the string is
not guaranteed to be parsed and interpreted exactly the same when inserted
into a different parent element. An example for carrying out such an attack
is by relying on the change of parsing behavior for foreign content or
misnested tags.

The Sanitizer API offers help against Mutated XSS, but relies on some amount of
cooperation by the developers. The `sanitize()` function does not handle strings
and is therefore unaffected. The `setHTML` function combines sanitization
with DOM modification and can implicitly apply the correct context. The
`sanitizeFor()` function combines parsing and sanitization, and relies on the
developer to supply the correct context for the eventual application of its
result.

If the data to be sanitized is available as a node tree, we encourage authors
to use the `sanitize()` function of the API which returns a
DocumentFragment and avoids risks that come with serialization and additional
parsing. Directly operating on a fragment after sanitization also comes with a
performance benefit, as the cost of additional serialization and parsing is
avoided.

A more complete treatement of mXSS can be found in [[MXSS]].

Cure53's [[DOMPURIFY]] is a clear inspiration for the API this document
describes, as is Internet Explorer's {{window.toStaticHTML()}}.
